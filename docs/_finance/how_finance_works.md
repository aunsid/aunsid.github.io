 ## Understanding the numbers

 ### Assets

 An asset is a resource with economic value that an individual, corporation, or a country owns with the expections.

 For e.g., Haagen Dasz owns the _ice cream_ that it is going to sell, the _factories_ and _raw materials_ to make the ice cream, and the _trucks_ to deliver it.


 Assets are ordered by the degree to which they can be turned into cash. Assets that can easily be converted into cash are called current assets, and they appear at the top.

 #### Cash and Marketable securities.
 Large cash holdings can generally be understood as
 * an insurance policy during uncertain times
 * a war chest for making future acquistions
 * a manifestation of the absence of investment opportunities.

 Much of the cash is held in government securities so that they can quickly be converted into cash if the need arises.


 #### Accounts receivable 
 Accounts receivable are amounts that a company expects to receive from its customer in the future. As trust grows in a relationship between a company and its customers, the company might be willing to allow customers to pay later.

 Companies that sell to other companies have a higher amount of sales reflected as receivables compared to businesses that sell direct to consumers.

#### Inventories
Are the goods or raw materials that become the goods that a company intends to sell. 

#### Property, plant, and equipment
It is the term for the tangible, long-term assets that a company uses to produce or distribute its products.

Other assets:
Likely to be intangible assets. Things you cannot put your hands on ut are valuable nonetheless - things like patents and brands.

For e.g., Coca-Cola has a very valuable brand, maybe the most valuable thing it owns but it really does not know valuable it is. So accountants ignore it. That's the accounting principle of conservatism.

When another company acquires another company for more than the value of its assets on their balance sheet, the difference is typically recorded on the acquiring company's balance sheet as goodwill. 

Microsoft spent $26.2 billion in 2016 to acquire LinkedIn, which had assets with a book value of $7.0 billion. The $19.2 billion Microsoft paid above the book value will show up as goodwill. 

### Liabilities and Shareholder's Equity
This section provides information on how companies finance themselves. There are two souces of finance for purchasing assets - lenders and owners. Liabilities represent those amounts financed by lenders to whom the company owes amounts. Shareholder's equity, or net worth, corresponds to the funds that shareholder's provide.

`Shareholder's equity = Assets - Liabilities`

Liabilities are ordered by the length of time companies have to repay them and liabilites that need to be paid back soon are labeled "current."

#### Accounts payable and notes payable
Accounts payable represent amounts due to others, often over ashort time, and typically to the company's suppliers. 

#### Accrued items
Broadly represents amount due to others for acitivities already delivered. One example is salaries: a balance sheet may be produced in the middle of a pay period, and the company may owe salaries that have not been paid yet.


#### Long-term debt
Unlike other liabilities, debt is distinctive because it has an explicit interest rate. 

#### Preferred and common stock
Shareholder's equity represents an ownership claim with a viable return. - in effect the owners get all residual cash from the business after costs and liabilities. Debt has a fixed return (i.e. interest rate) and no ownership claim. It gets paid before equity holders in the event of a bankruptcy. Equity holders have a variable return and an ownership claim but can be left with nothing if a company goes bankrupt. Typically, shareholders' equity, net wroth, owner's equity and common stock are all synonyms effectively. Shareholders' equity is not the amount originally invested in the company by the owners. As a company earns net profits, those profits can be paid out as dividends or be reinvested in the company. These retained earnings are a component of shareholders; quity as if the owners received a dividend and reinvested it in the company.

Preferred stock is often called a hybrid instrument. It combines elements of both debt and equity claims. Like debt, preferred stock dividend can be fixed and paid before common stock dividends. But like equity, it is paid after debt in the event of a bankruptcy. The unique attributes of preferred stock can allow a company to finance itself during precarious times.


## Understanding Ratios
Provides comparability across companies through time. 

#### Liquidity 
Measure the risk by emphasizing the company's ability to meet short-term obligations with assets that can be quickly be converted into cash. 

`Current Ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities`

Current ratio asks a question on behalf of a company's suppliers" Will this company be able to pay its suppliers if it needs to close. 

`Quick Ratio = (Current assets - inventory)/ Current liabilities`

The quick ratio resembles the current ratio, but excludes inventory. When a product goes obsolete the inventory should be considered worthless. It provides a more skeptical view of the company's finances.


#### Profitability
For every dollar of revenue, how much money does a firm get to keep after all relevant costs? 

`Profit Margin = Net Profit/ Revenue`

For every dollar of quity that shareholders invest in a business, what is their annual flow of income? 

`Return on Equity = Net profit/ Shareholders' equity`


Return on assets answers the question: How much profit does a company generate for every dollar of assets? This explains how effectively a company's assets are generating profits.

EBIT is also known as operating profit. Since some companies have different tax burdens and capital structures, EBIT provides a way to compare companies more directly.

Depreciation refers to how physical assets such as vehicles and equipment lose value over time. 

Amortization refers to the same phenomenon but for intangible assets.


### Financing and Leverage.
Let's consider your own personal balance sheet after buying a home. What if no mortgages were available for you to buy a home? If you had $100, you could only buy a home that was worth $100. With a mortgage market, you can borrow money to buy a home that is worth, say, $500.
